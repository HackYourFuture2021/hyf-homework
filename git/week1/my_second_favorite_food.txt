My Favourite Food

My favourite food is Biryani. It is a dish that is popular worldwide, and it takes time and practice to make it. It is prepared with basmati rice mixed with various spices like clove, bay leaves, cardamom, and vegetables.  

The main components of Biryani are basmati rice, vegetables, and spices. Biryani can be made both with or without meat. It is the layers of spices and vegetables that give Biryani its complex flavour, and these spices can be used both as a whole or as ground. In Biryani, we also use herbs and seeds. Also, the dish is sometimes topped with fresh herbs, caramelized onion, or dried fruits. 

My favourite food is vegetable Biryani due to its aroma and spices. Lucknow biryani is one of my favourite types of Biryani.

There are many types of Biryani, and each variety is named after the place where it was created. 

Some of the types of Biryani are:

Hyderabadi Biryani: This Biryani is one of the most popular types of Biryani, and it contains marinated meat and cooked along with rice. It is seasoned with saffron and coconut. 
Sindhi Biryani: This Biryani has a special aroma and is hugely popular in Pakistan. It is popular due to its delicate meat, fragrant rice, and spicy taste. It is made with basmati rice, vegetables, spices, and meat. 
Calcutta Biryani â€“ This Biryani uses potatoes and eggs often, and the marinade is made using nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and other spices. The rice is flavoured in a nice way with rose water and is yellow in colour. 
Malabar Biryani: This is a biryani made in Kerala and is made with Khyma rice mixed with ghee. 
Mughlai biryani: This is another popular biryani in India and is cooked with chicken, curd, almond paste, dry fruits, ghee, and green chillies. 
Ambur biryani: This is a famous biryani of Tamil Nadu, and in this, rice and meat are cooked separately, and after that, they are brought together with curd and mint leaves. 
Lucknow biryani: This type of Biryani is famous in Uttar Pradesh, and the spice is not that intense. 
 

All in all, I love homemade food like Dal rice, paneer masala, rajma rice, and Biryani. We should try to eat homecooked food as much as possible because junk food like burger, pizza, etc., can harm our health in the long run. It is best to eat simple food cooked at home because it fills our stomach properly, is pocket-friendly, and keeps us healthy and fit.
