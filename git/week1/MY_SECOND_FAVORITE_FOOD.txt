Ask anyone from Arab countries what their favorite dessert is, and without hesitation they will most likely respond: Kanafeh. This iconic dessert, spelled a myriad of ways, from kanafeh to knafe to kanafeh, is undoubtedly the most popular dessert among Arabs the world over. This layered confection consists of shredded phyllo dough called “kataife” doused with ghee or melted butter, covering a layer of gooey sweet and melted cheese. The whole pastry is then doused with a sweet syrup accented with lemon, or even rose water depending on preference.  Chopped pistachios crown the top with extra crunch and contrasting color. Eaten together, the rich layers are sweet, creamy, buttery, and crunchy.
